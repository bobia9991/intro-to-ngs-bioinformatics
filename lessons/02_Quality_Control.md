## Goals
- Understand FastQ file format
- Run FastQC to asses data quality

## Take a look at our raw data

### Fastq format
From our course directory `into-to-ngs` change into the raw data directory:
```markdown
cd raw_data
```

Use the command `head` to look at the first few lines of our first fastq file.

```markdown
head na12878_1.fq
```

Result (arrows on the right show explanation of each line):

```bash
@SRR098401.109756285/1                   <-- Sequence identifier: @Read ID / 1 or 2 of pair
GACTCACGTAACTTTAAACTCTAACAGAAATATACTA…   <-- Sequence
+                                        <-- + (optionally lists the sequence identifier again)
CAEFGDG?BCGGGEEDGGHGHGDFHEIEGGDDDD…      <-- Quality String
```

### Base Quality Scores

The symbols we see in the read quality string are an encoding of the quality score.

A quality score represents the probability that the nucleotide in the DNA sequence produced was not the same as the nucleotide in the sample being sequenced.
The the calibration of quality scores is performed by the manufacturer of the sequencing instrument.
Calibration is performed by sequencing many well-characterized samples from multiple organisms and studying the correspondence 
between properties of the signal generated by the cluster being sequenced and the accuracy of the resulting sequence.

Looking back at our sample read, we can see that the first base has an encoded quality score of `C`.

```bash
@SRR098401.109756285/1                   <-- Sequence identifier: @Read ID / 1 or 2 of pair
GACTCACGTAACTTTAAACTCTAACAGAAATATACTA…   <-- Sequence
+                                        <-- + (optionally lists the sequence identifier again)
CAEFGDG?BCGGGEEDGGHGHGDFHEIEGGDDDD…      <-- Quality String
<span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.
```

Using Figure 1, we see that C encodes a quality of 34.
Using Figure 2, we see that the probability is < 1/1000 of that base being an error.

## FastQC
FastQC is widely used tool for both DNA and RNA sequencing data that is run on each fastq file.

To use, load the module: 
```bash
module load fastqc/0.11.8
```

To see the input options, type:
```markdown
fastqc --help
```

Result:
```markdown
fastqc --help

            FastQC - A high throughput sequence QC analysis tool

SYNOPSIS

	fastqc seqfile1 seqfile2 .. seqfileN

    fastqc [-o output dir] [--(no)extract] [-f fastq|bam|sam] 
           [-c contaminant file] seqfile1 .. seqfileN
...
```

Since FastQC can run on multiple files at once, we'll use a wildcard "*" to indicate each file in the folder "raw_data":
```bash
mkdir fastqc
fastqc raw_data/*.fq -o fastqc --extract
```

Result:
```markdown

The new tab that opens in the browser has the results of FastQC for the first reads in the sample.

###Per base sequence quality

Explanations adapted from [https://dnacore.missouri.edu/PDF/FastQC_Manual.pdf][https://dnacore.missouri.edu/PDF/FastQC_Manual.pdf]

This view shows an overview of the range of quality values across all bases at each
position in the FastQ file

GOOD BAD

For each position a BoxWhisker type plot is drawn. The elements of the plot are as
follows:
- The central red line is the median value
- The yellow box represents the inter-quartile range (25-75%)
- The upper and lower whiskers represent the 10% and 90% points
- The blue line represents the mean quality

The y-axis on the graph shows the quality scores. The higher the score the better the
base call. The background of the graph divides the y axis into very good quality calls
(green), calls of reasonable quality (orange), and calls of poor quality (red). The quality of
calls on most platforms will degrade as the run progresses, so it is common to see base
calls falling into the orange area towards the end of a read.


###Per sequence quality scores
The per sequence quality score report allows you to see if a subset of your sequences
have universally low quality values. It is often the case that a subset of sequences will
have universally poor quality, often because they are poorly imaged (on the edge of the
field of view etc), however these should represent only a small percentage of the total
sequences.

GOOD BAD


###Per base sequence content
Per Base Sequence Content plots out the proportion of each base position in a file for
which each of the four normal DNA bases has been called.

GOOD BAD

In a random library you would expect that there would be little to no difference between
the different bases of a sequence run, so the lines in this plot should run parallel with each
other. The relative amount of each base should reflect the overall amount of these bases
in your genome, but in any case they should not be hugely imbalanced from each other.
If you see strong biases which change in different bases then this usually indicates an
overrepresented sequence which is contaminating your library. A bias which is consistent
across all bases either indicates that the original library was sequence biased, or that
there was a systematic problem during the sequencing of the library.

###Per sequence GC content

This module measures the GC content across the whole length of each sequence in a file
and compares it to a modelled normal distribution of GC content.

In a normal random library you would expect to see a roughly normal distribution of GC
content where the central peak corresponds to the overall GC content of the underlying
genome. Since we don't know the the GC content of the genome the modal GC content is
calculated from the observed data and used to build a reference distribution.
An unusually shaped distribution could indicate a contaminated library or some other kinds
of biased subset. A normal distribution which is shifted indicates some systematic bias
which is independent of base position. If there is a systematic bias which creates a shifted
normal distribution then this won't be flagged as an error by the module since it doesn't
know what your genome's GC content should be.

###Per base N content

If a sequencer is unable to make a base call with sufficient confidence then it will normally
substitute an N rather than a conventional base] call
This module plots out the percentage of base calls at each position for which an N was
called.


###Sequence Length Distribution

Some high throughput sequencers generate sequence fragments of uniform length, but
others can contain reads of wildly varying lengths. Even within uniform length libraries
some pipelines will trim sequences to remove poor quality base calls from the end.
This module generates a graph showing the distribution of fragment sizes in the file which
was analysed

###Sequence Duplication Levels

In a diverse library most sequences will occur only once in the final set. A low level of
duplication may indicate a very high level of coverage of the target sequence, but a high
level of duplication is more likely to indicate some kind of enrichment bias (eg PCR over
amplification).
This module counts the degree of duplication for every sequence in the set and creates a
plot showing the relative number of sequences with different degrees of duplication.

###Overrepresented sequences

A normal high-throughput library will contain a diverse set of sequences, with no individual
sequence making up a tiny fraction of the whole. Finding that a single sequence is very
overrepresented in the set either means that it is highly biologically significant, or indicates
that the library is contaminated, or not as diverse as you expected.
This module lists all of the sequence which make up more than 0.1% of the total. To
conserve memory only sequences which appear in the first 200,000 sequences are
tracked to the end of the file. It is therefore possible that a sequence which is
overrepresented but doesn't appear at the start of the file for some reason could be
missed by this module.
For each overrepresented sequence the program will look for matches in a database of
common contaminants and will report the best hit it finds. Hits must be at least 20bp in
length and have no more than 1 mismatch. Finding a hit doesn't necessarily mean that this
is the source of the contamination, but may point you in the right direction. It's also worth
pointing out that many adapter sequences are very similar to each other so you may get a
hit reported which isn't technically correct, but which has very similar sequence to the
actual match.
Because the duplication detection requires an exact sequence match over the whole
length of the sequence any reads over 75bp in length are truncated to 50bp for the
purposes of this analysis. Even so, longer reads are more likely to contain sequencing
errors which will artificially increase the observed diversity and will tend to underrepresent
highly duplicated sequences.

###Adapter Content

This looks for common adapters in the sequence.
