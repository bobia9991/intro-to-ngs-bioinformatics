Approximate time: 20 minutes

## Goals

- Format of FastQ files
- Run FastQC to asses quality of reads

## Take a look at our raw data

### Fastq format
From our main directory `into-to-ngs` change into the raw data directory:
```markdown
cd raw_data
```

Use the command `head` to look at the first few lines of our first fastq file.

```markdown
head na12878_1.fq
```

Result (arrows on the right show explanation of each line):

```markdown
@SRR098401.109756285/1                   <-- Sequence identifier: @Read ID / 1 or 2 of pair
GACTCACGTAACTTTAAACTCTAACAGAAATATACTA…   <-- Sequence
+                                        <-- + (optionally lists the sequence identifier again)
CAEFGDG?BCGGGEEDGGHGHGDFHEIEGGDDDD…      <-- Quality String
```

### Base Quality Scores

The symbols we see in the read quality string are an encoding of the quality score.

A quality score is a prediction of the probability of an error in base calling.
The the calibration of quality scores is performed by the manufacturer of the sequencing instrument.
The method is sequencing many well-characterized samples from multiple organisms and studying the correspondence 
between properties of the signal generated by the cluster and the accuracy of the base call.

Looking back at our sample read, we can see that the first base has an encoded of C.
Using Figure 1, we see that C encodes a quality of 34.
Using Figure 2, we see that the probability is < 1/1000 of that base being an error.

## FastQC

Now we'll calculate the quality of our reads

## MultiQC

Now we'll aggregate
